# OSMM-Highways-Network-Support
A repository of support material for the OS MasterMap Highways Network product. These are intended to help you get started with the data and build an appriopriate table structure. You may need to adpat the workbenches to ensure the data output matches a specific software solution.

**Please note: The "drop table" setting on the writer in the FME workbenches has been set to "Yes". However if you are running a large load as batches this may need to be set to "No" to prevent loss of data.**
